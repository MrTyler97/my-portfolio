            <h1>About Me</h1>
            I'm currently a senior at Eastern Michigan University majoring in Computer Science.
            I'm also Vice President of the NSBE chapter at my university. I have an interenst in Software Engineering, Systems Engineering, Data Engineering, as well as AI/ML development. 
            Throughout my academic career, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects and research projects. From refactroing a pipeline for the Department of Chemistry to 
            creating a desktop application for managing your files. I'm always looking to learn new skills and expand my knowledge in the field of computer science.

            <h3>Pipeline Refactoring</h3>
            <p> At Eastern Michigan University’s Department of Chemistry, I refactored and fully automated a Linux‑based 
              Python pipeline—leveraging Git and CompuCell3D—to simulate and analyze autophagic vacuoles. By applying Agile methodologies and delivering 
              bi‑weekly updates, I boosted research workflow speed by 20% and optimized simulation parameters for greater accuracy and reliability.</p>

            <h3>Autonomous Drone Navigation</h3>
            <p>In my Drone Technology role, I wrote Python scripts to gather sensor data and applied nested loops and conditional logic to fine‑tune calibration—enabling 
              a drone to autonomously navigate complex mazes—and was honored with a Celebration of Excellence award.</p>
