                      <p>KeepOrDelete is a fun and interactive way to manage files by providing a game-like experience. 
                        Users can preview files, view basic information about them, and rename them. They then decide to either "Keep" or "Delete" the file based on the provided information.
                        This application also offers an AI assistant to help users rename their files.
