            <h1>About Me</h1>
            I'm currently a senior at Eastern Michigan University majoring in Computer Science.
            I'm also Vice President of the NSBE chapter at my university. I have an interenst in Software Engineering, Systems Engineering, Data Engineering, as well as AI/ML development. 
            Throughout my academic career, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects and research projects. From refactroing a pipeline for the Department of Chemistry to 
            creating a desktop application for managing your files. I'm always looking to learn new skills and expand my knowledge in the field of computer science.

            <h2>Incoming Software Engineer Intern @ Honeywell</h2>
            <p>To be continued... </p>

            <h2>Research Assistant @ Eastern Michigan University</h2>
            <p> At Eastern Michigan University’s Department of Chemistry, I refactored and fully automated a Linux‑based 
              Python pipeline—leveraging Git and CompuCell3D—to simulate and analyze autophagic vacuoles. By applying Agile methodologies and delivering 
              bi‑weekly updates, I boosted research workflow speed by 20% and optimized simulation parameters for greater accuracy and reliability.</p>

            <h2> Research Assistant @ Eastern Michigan University</h2>
            <p>In my Drone Technology role, I wrote Python scripts to gather sensor data and applied nested loops and conditional logic to fine‑tune calibration—enabling 
              a drone to autonomously navigate complex mazes—and was honored with a Celebration of Excellence award.</p>

            <h2> Teacher Assistant & Grader @ Eastern Michigan University</h2>
            <p>I served as a Teaching Assistant and Grader for Intro to Programming and Data Structures in Java—collaborating on final projects to 
              reinforce core concepts and providing hands‑on guidance in data structures, object‑oriented design, and algorithm efficiency.</p>
